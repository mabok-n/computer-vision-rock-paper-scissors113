Rock-Paper-Scissors Computer Vision Interactive Game

Description
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, 
paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. 
Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.

This project is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the user can play against the computer using a camera. 
The computer detects the user's hand gesture through the camera and determines the winner accordingly. 
The aim of the project is to create an engaging and interactive experience that leverages computer vision technology to recognize hand gestures in real-time. 
Through this project, we learned about computer vision, gesture recognition, and integrating these technologies into a user-friendly application.
